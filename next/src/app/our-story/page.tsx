          Think back to the not-quite-post-COVID haze of 2021, when venturing
          out in pants with a zipper felt both brave and reckless. It was during
          one of these early attempts to conjure memories of socializing in
          indoor public spaces that we first crossed paths, among a group of
          mutual friends at a downtown show. My brain, preoccupied with trying
          to regain the atrophied muscle of small talk-making, was admittedly
          not quite ready to tackle the complexities of flirting.

          Fast forward a year of sporadic run-ins and meme exchanges, and I
          found myself housesitting for James’s best friend. Suddenly, James
          began appearing under the noble guise of "helping out" with his
          friend's musical gear. Was it selfless? Maybe. Was it charming? Enough
          for me to say yes to a sushi date. The rest, as they say, is history.

          10+ trips, 1 puppy, and 3 joy-filled years later, we couldn’t be more
          excited to formally merge our lives amidst the company of our dearest
          friends and family.{" "}
