          Pecan Springs Ranch sits right on the edge of Dripping Springs, TX
          while still falling within a comfortable 20-30 minute driving range to
          downtown Austin.

          Dripping Springs serves up all the Hill Country charm you never knew
          you needed, perfect for those craving a rustic retreat filled with
          rolling hills, BBQ joints, and what out-of-staters might consider a
          superfluous amount of Texas Flags. You can sip your way down Fitzhugh
          Road, hopping between its burgeoning wineries and breweries, or
          channel your inner adventurer with a day trip to Reimer’s Ranch or
          Hamilton Pool.

          Inn, and A Loft Hotel.

          If you’re more of a city rat craving live music, a two-stepping jaunt,
          or an indulgent meal (or six) — we’d recommend staying in Austin!
          Don’t worry, there will be plenty of Texas flags here too. It won’t be
          a problem to catch an Uber or Lyft to the venue from anywhere in
          Austin.

          Austin boutique hotels we love: The Line, The Driskill, Carpenter,
          Hotel Van Zandt.
